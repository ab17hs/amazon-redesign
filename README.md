# Amazon Website Redesign


This project is a redesigned and simplified version of the Amazon website.  
The main goal is to improve user experience, navigation, and usability across all devices.  
The focus is on cleaner layout, faster product discovery, and easier checkout — all while supporting Amazon’s business goals such as increasing engagement, purchases, and promoting services like Amazon Prime.
